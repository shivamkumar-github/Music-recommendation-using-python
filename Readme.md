This project involves building a Music Recommendation System using Python and the Spotify API. The system leverages data science to analyze user preferences and listening behavior. It employs algorithms like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches. The Spotify API provides access to music-related data, allowing developers to build innovative applications. The recommendation system considers both music audio features and weighted popularity to provide personalized suggestions, enhancing user engagement. The provided Python code demonstrates the implementation, including obtaining credentials, collecting music data, and generating recommendations based on content and popularity. The final hybrid recommendation function combines both aspects for a comprehensive and tailored user experience.
